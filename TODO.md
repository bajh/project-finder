##Bugs:

- uniq might remove relevant projects <- NO! Why do I have to call uniq?

##Features:

- be able to leave a project 
- implement AJAX to select skills from categories
- as admin be able to see prospective collaborators
- as admin be able to remove team members
- as admin get notification when someone wants to join team
- be able to endorse people's skills
- have a chat
- display notification next to gravatar (treehouse style)
- if you don't have gravatar, display name instead
- project removes skill if position filled (conversely adds skill if collaborator leaves)
- have little arrows that show you where your side-nav is and where you have to go
- by signing up, you agree to our terms of service

##TODO

- think about how to implement endorsements 
- where do we want to put the chat
- how to have endorsements

##Other Ideas
